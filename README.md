# UofC Statistical Learning Study Group
Public repository for the UofC Statistical Learning study group. The group will meet over the summer of 2019 for 13 presentations given by university students and staff on different topics. The objective of the group is to develop foundational knowledge and explore new developments in the fields of statistics and machine learning. 

The group is sponsored by the GSA Quality Money Fund, The UofC Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Commitee (BMEG), and the McCaig Trainee Council (MTC)

### Curriculum
The content was selected according to the interests and knowledge of the presenting members. Related topics are (roughly) grouped together.

#### 1 Information Theory 
Information, entropy (conditional, joint, relative, differential), mutual information

#### 2 Stochastic Processes
Random walk (levy process), brownian motion, gaussian process, markov process, martingale

#### 3 Decision Trees/Forests 
Decsion trees, bagging (bootstrap aggregation), random forests, information gain

#### 4 Reinforcement Learning 
Markov decision process, policy learning (brute force, monte carlo, Q-learning), exploration vs exploitation (multi-armed bandit problem)

#### 5 Generative Models 
VAE, GAN, deep belief network, style transfer.

#### 6 Interpretable Models
Explainability vs interpretability; feature visualization; activation-based, gradient-based, and embedding-based methods. 

#### 7 Computational Anatomy 
Diffeomorphisms (morphisms, isomorphisms, homeomorphisms, manifolds), diffeomorphism groups, matching/registration (LDMM)

#### 8 Recurrent Neural Networks 
Fully recurrent network, LSTM, training (supervised, reinforcement)

#### 9 Ensemble Methods
