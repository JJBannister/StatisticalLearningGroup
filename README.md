# UofC Statistical Learning Study Group
Public repository for the UofC Statistical Learning study group. The group will meet over the summer of 2019 for 12 presentations given by university students and staff on different topics. The objective of the group is to develop foundational knowledge and explore new developments in the fields of statistics and machine learning. 

#### Presenting Members:
- Jordan Bannister
- Deepthi Rajashekar
- Lucas Lo Vercio
- Van Anh Le

#### 3 Decision Trees/Forests 
Decsion trees, bagging (bootstrap aggregation), feature bagging, random forests, information gain

#### 4 Reinforcement Learning 
Markov decision process, policy learning (brute force, monte carlo, Q-learning), exploration vs exploitation (multi-armed bandit problem)

#### 5 Generative Models 
VAE, GAN, deep belief network, style transfer.

#### 6 Computational Anatomy
