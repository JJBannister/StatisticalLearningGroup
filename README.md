# UofC Statistical Learning Study Group
Public repository for the UofC Statistical Learning study group. The group will meet over the summer of 2019 for 13 presentations given by university students and staff on different topics. The objective of the group is to develop foundational knowledge and explore new developments in the fields of statistics and machine learning. 

The group is sponsored by the GSA Quality Money Fund, The UofC Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Commitee (BMEG), and the McCaig Trainee Council (MTC)
