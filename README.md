# UofC Statistical Learning Study Group
Public repository for the UofC Statistical Learning study group. The group will meet over the summer of 2019 for approximately 10 presentations given by university students and staff on different topics. The objective of the group is to develop foundational knowledge and explore new developments in the fields of statistics and machine learning. 

#### Presenting Members:
- Jordan Bannister
- Deepthi Rajashekar
- Anup Tuladhar
- Pauline Mouches
- Anthony Winder
- Lucas Lo Vercio
- Nagesh Subbanna

### Curriculum
The content was selected according to the interests and knowledge of the presenting members. The content was also structured such that foundational lectures are presented early in the summer, and advanced or application focussed lectures are presented later on.

Frequentist vs. Bayesian, bayes theorem, maximum likelihood estimates, maximum a posterori estimates, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Variational Inference (VI). 

#### 2 Probabilistic Graphical Models 
Bayesian networks, markov networks, conditional independence, joint probability factorization.

#### 3 Decision Trees
